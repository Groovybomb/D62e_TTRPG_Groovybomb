### Phase 7: Roll System Overhaul — Wild Die, Exploding Dice, Re-Roll & Double Down
- [x] Created frontend/src/utils/dice.js — dice rolling with wild die and exploding 6s
- [x] Wild die (first die): explodes on 6 (keep rolling+adding), complication on 1 (counts as 0, remove highest other die)
- [x] Created frontend/src/components/RollModal.jsx — full roll popup with setup and result phases
- [x] Roll popup setup: shows dice breakdown, extra dice +/- control, Double Dice button (costs 1 Hero Point)
- [x] Roll popup results: wild die shown larger with color (green=6, red=1), exploding chain displayed
- [x] Re-Roll button (costs 1 Hero Point, flagged in roll log)
- [x] Double Down button (free re-roll, flagged in roll log, complication on 2nd failure)
- [x] Roll buttons on every attribute header and every skill row in Character Sheet
- [x] Roll buttons hidden in edit mode
- [x] Hero Points automatically decremented on Double Dice and Re-Roll (saved to backend)

- [x] Roll system changed from success-counting to sum-based (matches D6 2e rules)
- [x] GamePage reads rolls from backend (auto-refreshes every 5 seconds)
- [x] Roll log shows wild die details, exploding dice, complication notices, roll flags (RE-ROLL, DOUBLE DOWN, DOUBLED)
- [x] Quick Roll selector on Game tab also opens roll modal
- [x] Added comprehensive CSS for modal, dice faces, roll flags, buttons

### Phase 8: Chat System + GM-Initiated Roll System
- [x] **Chat persistence** — messages saved to backend via POST /api/messages, loaded with 3s polling
- [x] Created backend/src/routes/messages.js — GET (last 100) and POST endpoints
- [x] Chat messages interleaved with rolls in Roll Log / Chat tab (sorted by timestamp)
- [x] Fixed lowdb v4/Node 24 compatibility — changed imports in db.js
- [x] **GM Roll System** — full roll-calling workflow:
  - [x] GM picks skill/attribute from dropdown, sets DC (static number or dice roll)
  - [x] Static DC: number input with difficulty quick-select buttons (5 Very Easy → 40 Mythical)
  - [x] Dice DC: adjustable dice count with Roll DC button, shows individual dice + sum
  - [x] "Call for Roll" creates request, broadcasts to all logged-in players via polling
- [x] Created backend/src/routes/gmRolls.js — 6 endpoints for full GM roll lifecycle
- [x] Added gmRollRequests and gmRollResponses collections to db.js
- [x] **Player GM Roll Modal** (frontend/src/components/GMRollModal.jsx):
  - [x] Pops up over any tab (mounted in App.jsx, polled every 3s)
  - [x] Three phases: setup → result → choice/done
  - [x] Setup: dice pool from character's skill, extra dice, double dice option
  - [x] Result: dice visual, total vs DC, outcome badge, re-roll/double-down
  - [x] Choice scenarios for wild die 6 (exceptional vs success) and wild die 1 (partial vs fail)
- [x] **Outcome evaluation** (frontend/src/utils/dice.js — evaluateGMRollOutcome):
  - [x] Exceptional Success: beat DC + wild 6 → +1 HP
  - [x] Success: beat DC → +2 HP (wild 6, no explosion needed), +1 HP (needed explosion), 0 HP (other)
  - [x] Partial Success: beat DC + wild 1 → +1 HP with complication (or choose fail for +2 HP)
  - [x] Fail: total ≤ DC → 0 HP
  - [x] Critical Fail: total ≤ DC + wild 1 → +1 HP with complication
- [x] **Hero Points auto-updated** on character sheet after GM roll outcomes
- [x] **GM response tracking** — GM tab shows active request, response count, individual results with outcome badges
- [x] **Roll Log display** — GM_ROLL entries show character name, [GM Roll] tag, skill, total vs DC, outcome badge, HP delta
- [x] Added ~200 lines of GM roll CSS (modal, banners, outcome badges, choice buttons, response cards)
- [x] **Browser tested** — all core flows verified working (see Testing Checklist)

### Phase 8b: Damage Roll Buttons + Exceptional Success Doubling
- [x] **Damage Roll button** on each weapon in Character Sheet (next to damage value)
  - [x] Parses damage formula (e.g., "4D6" → 4 dice) via regex `/(\d+)D/i`
  - [x] Opens DamageRollModal — plain d6 sum, no wild die mechanics
  - [x] Supports Extra Dice, Double Dice (HP cost), Re-Roll (HP cost), Double Down
  - [x] Red-themed visual (border, dice faces, total display)
  - [x] Posts to `POST /api/rolls/damage` with characterId, characterName, weaponName, damageFormula, diceCount, diceRolled, total, doubled, extraDice, rollFlag
- [x] **Damage rolls in Roll Log** — [Damage] tag (red), weapon name, formula, total, dice array
- [x] **Exceptional Success doubling** — free dice doubling across all roll modals:
  - [x] RollModal (skill/attribute rolls) — green "Exceptional Success" button, free doubling
  - [x] DamageRollModal (weapon damage) — green "Exceptional Success" button, free doubling
  - [x] GMRollModal (GM-initiated rolls) — green "Exceptional Success" button, free doubling
  - [x] `doubleSource` state tracks 'heroPoint' vs 'exceptional' — Undo only refunds HP for heroPoint source
  - [x] Doubled note shows "(Exceptional Success)" or "(Hero Point spent)" in result phase
- [x] Added `.exceptional-double-btn` CSS styles (green border/text, green hover fill)
- [x] **Browser tested** — damage rolls, exceptional success on all modals, Roll Log display all verified

### v1.0.0 Refactoring & Documentation
- [x] **Extracted shared `API_URL`** — created `frontend/src/config.js`, removed 6 duplicate declarations across pages/components
- [x] **Extracted shared outcome constants** — created `frontend/src/data/outcomes.js` (`OUTCOME_LABELS`, `OUTCOME_COLORS`), removed duplication from GameMasterPage, GMRollModal, GamePage
- [x] **Server-side filtering** — added `?userId=` query param support to characters and spaceships routes, updated frontend to use params instead of fetching all + filtering client-side
- [x] **Removed dead backend code** — deleted unused `rollD6`, `rollMultipleDice`, `countWildDice`, `countSuccesses` from `utils.js` (all dice rolling is client-side)
- [x] **Fixed db.js initialization bug** — changed `if (!db.data[key])` to `if (db.data[key] === undefined)` to prevent skipping falsy-but-valid values
- [x] **Fixed redundant no-op ternary** in GMRollModal — removed `hasChoice ? outcome : outcome` pattern
- [x] **Removed unused imports** — cleaned up `getAllSkills`, `getDicePool`, duplicate `ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITIONS` imports
- [x] **Removed unused dependency** — removed `xlsx` devDependency from root package.json
- [x] **Version bumps** — all package.json files bumped to 1.0.0
- [x] **Simplified .env.example** — removed unused JWT, WebSocket, database, session config vars
- [x] **Full documentation rewrite** — README.md, QUICKSTART.md, backend/README.md, frontend/README.md, CLAUDE.md all updated for v1 accuracy
- [x] **Browser tested** — all features verified working after refactoring, zero console errors

## 📋 Roll System Architecture (Phase 7)

The dice rolling system follows D6 Second Edition rules:

**Wild Die Mechanics:**
- First die rolled is the "Wild Die" — rolls 1-6 like normal
- If Wild Die = 6: **Explodes** — roll another d6, add to total, repeat until not-6
- If Wild Die = 1: **Complication** — wild die counts as 0, highest other die removed from total
- All other dice just sum normally

**Roll Flow:**
1. Click "Roll" button on Character Sheet (attribute or skill)
2. Modal opens showing dice breakdown (e.g., "Brawn 5D + Athletics 3D = 8D6")
3. Can add Extra Dice (+/- buttons) or Double Dice (costs 1 Hero Point, doubles total)
4. Execute roll → Wild die shown in large colored box (green=6, red=1)
5. See total and choose: Re-Roll (costs 1 HP) or Double Down (free, complication on fail)
6. Roll saved to backend and appears in Roll Log / Chat tab

**Key Files Created (Phase 7):**
- `frontend/src/utils/dice.js` — dice rolling logic with wild die + exploding mechanics
- `frontend/src/components/RollModal.jsx` — the roll popup (setup + result phases)
- `frontend/src/pages/CharacterPage.jsx` — updated with Roll buttons on every skill/attribute
- `frontend/src/pages/GamePage.jsx` — updated to read rolls from backend, quick-roll dropdown
- `backend/src/routes/rolls.js` — updated to store wild die details, roll flags (REROLL, DOUBLE_DOWN)
- CSS added to `frontend/src/App.css` — modal, dice faces, roll flags, buttons

## 📋 GM Roll System Architecture (Phase 8)

**Polling-Based Communication (No WebSocket):**
- GM creates a roll request → stored in `gmRollRequests` collection
- Players poll `GET /api/gm-rolls/active?userId=X` every 3 seconds from App.jsx
- When a pending request is found → `GMRollModal` pops up over whatever page the player is on
- Player responses stored in `gmRollResponses` + copied to `rolls` as `rollType: "GM_ROLL"`
- GM polls for responses on their tab, can close the request when done

**Outcome Evaluation (evaluateGMRollOutcome in dice.js):**
- total > DC + wild 6 → PENDING_CHOICE (player picks: exceptional +1 HP or success +2/+1 HP)
- total > DC + wild 2-5 → SUCCESS (0 HP)
- total > DC + wild 1 → PENDING_CHOICE (player picks: partial +1 HP or fail +2 HP)
- total ≤ DC + wild 2-6 → FAIL (0 HP)
- total ≤ DC + wild 1 → CRITICAL_FAIL (+1 HP, complication)

**"Needed Explosion" check:** When wild die = 6 and player beats DC, compute `totalWithoutExplosion = total - (wildDie.value - 6)`. If ≤ DC, explosion was needed → success only awards +1 HP instead of +2.

**DC Dice Rolls:** Use plain d6 sums (no wild die mechanics) — `rollPlainDice()` in dice.js.

**Key Files Created (Phase 8):**
- `backend/src/routes/messages.js` — chat message endpoints (GET/POST)
- `backend/src/routes/gmRolls.js` — 6 endpoints for GM roll lifecycle
- `frontend/src/components/GMRollModal.jsx` — player-facing GM roll popup (setup → result → choice)
- `frontend/src/utils/dice.js` — added `rollPlainDice()` and `evaluateGMRollOutcome()`
- `frontend/src/pages/GameMasterPage.jsx` — rebuilt with roll initiator, response tracking
- `frontend/src/pages/GamePage.jsx` — updated with chat persistence and GM_ROLL display
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` — added GM roll polling and modal mounting at app level

## 📊 Current Status

### What Works Now
✅ User registration with display name, login
✅ Full D62e character sheet: 7 attributes (Agility, Brawn, Knowledge, Perception, Charm, Mechanical, Technical), 30+ skills
✅ Character weapons, talents, flaws, perks, items, notes
✅ Dice pool: attribute + skill = total D6 to roll
✅ Computed Dodge (Perception ×5) and Parry (Agility ×5)
✅ **Roll buttons on every skill and attribute** — click to open roll modal
✅ **Damage Roll buttons on weapons** — plain d6 sum (no wild die), red-themed modal
✅ **Exceptional Success doubling** — free dice doubling on skill, attribute, damage, and GM rolls
✅ **Wild die system** — explodes on 6, complication on 1
✅ **Roll modal** — setup (add dice, double for 1 HP), result (show dice), options (re-roll, double down)
✅ **Hero Points** — spent on Double Dice and Re-Roll, auto-saved to backend
✅ **Roll log** — shows all rolls with wild die details, flags, color-coded dice
✅ **Chat persistence** — messages saved to db, 3s polling, interleaved with rolls in Roll Log / Chat
✅ **GM Roll System** — GM calls for rolls, players get popup on any tab, 5-tier outcomes with auto HP
✅ **Spacecraft** — stats (Navicomp, Maneuverability, Engines, Hull, Shield), weapons, crew, reference panels
✅ **Game Master tab** — roll initiator (static/dice DC), response tracking, difficulty table, recent rolls
✅ **Dark-themed UI** — responsive, modern, tab-based navigation
✅ All data persists in lowdb (backend/data/db.json)

### What Still Needs Work
- [ ] **WebSocket** — true real-time (currently polling every 3-5s, works but not instant)
- [ ] **Game sessions** — group players, manage initiative, track resources
- [ ] **Attack rolls UI** — opposed roll system on Game page (damage rolls done on Character Sheet)
- [ ] **Password hashing** — currently plain text (use bcrypt)
- [ ] **JWT tokens** — proper authentication (currently just user ID)
- [ ] **Input validation** — form validation on client and server

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Short Term (Critical Path)
1. **WebSocket** — replace polling with real-time push (currently 3-5s polling works but isn't instant)
2. **Game sessions** — let players join a session, share rolls/chat within a group
3. **Attack rolls UI** — opposed roll system on Game page (damage rolls already on Character Sheet)

### Medium Term (Polish & UX)
1. **Password hashing** — use bcrypt in backend auth routes
2. **JWT tokens** — replace plain user ID with proper auth tokens
3. **Input validation** — validate character names, skill values, etc.
4. **Error handling** — better user-facing error messages

### Long Term (Polish)
1. **Animations** — dice rolling animation, pop effects on explode
2. **Sound effects** — dice sounds, level-up ding
3. **Mobile optimization** — make UI touch-friendly
4. **Dark mode toggle** — option for light theme
5. **Database migration** — move to PostgreSQL if needed

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

- **Passwords plain text** — stored unhashed in db.json; use bcrypt for production
- **No authentication** — user ID in localStorage, anyone with ID can modify their characters
- **Polling, not WebSocket** — GM rolls poll every 3s, chat every 3s, roll log every 5s (functional but not instant)
- **No game sessions** — all rolls/chat in one global log, no grouping by game
- **lowdb limitations** — file-based JSON, fine for 2-4 players, not scalable
- **No input validation** — should validate skill values (0-5?), names, etc.
- **GM Roll modal scrolling** — on smaller viewports the modal may require scrolling to reach buttons
- **Single character per player for GM rolls** — currently uses first character; multi-character selection not implemented
